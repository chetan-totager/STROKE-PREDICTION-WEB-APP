# STROKE-PREDICTION-WEB-APP
End-to-end machine learning web application for stroke risk prediction using SVM, Flask, and React.
# Stroke Prediction Web Application

A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts the likelihood of stroke
based on user health data. The system uses a trained ML model in the backend and
provides predictions through a simple web interface.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- React.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Features
- Predicts stroke risk using a machine learning model
- REST API built with Flask
- Interactive frontend using React
- Clean separation of backend and frontend
